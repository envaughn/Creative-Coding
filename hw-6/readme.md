### Week Summary
1. I tested a lot of different functions to better visualize their effect. I misunderstood which functions we should choose and picked Noise although it wasn't on the list, and then couldn't find a use for another one once I realized my mistake, so I used it twice. 
2. Made the triangle animation first, by modifying a the rotate function to include noise.
3. From the beginning wanted this animation to be "infinite" so I made an array of colors that included the background blue, to give the effect of clearing the canvas. The random() function selects the preset colors.
4. I experimented with a few fills and mouseX/mouseY modifications for the centered circle, but eventually preferred the noFill, with just a small boost to mouse input
5. Also mapped the blue value of the circle stroke with the mouse input, so it would change from yellow to white.
6. I was glad to have the the javascript object grouping for the lines, it made them a lot easier to manage. I originally wanted them to "wobble" on the edges of the screen, but the modulo function only sent the lines back to their starting position after twisting them around the canvas, which I genuinely prefer.

### Process
Although I am happy with the end result, I found this assignment extremely discouraging at times. While the other assignments seemed overwhelming, it was easier to learn a concept by running into the problem that the function solved. Needing to create the conditions for a function to be used turned out to be extremely difficult, partly because of how I conceptualize numbers due to a learning disability. I put at least 4 evenings and afternoons into this assignment from puzzling on which variables should be declared and how they should interact. I'm not sure if I'm going to get much faster either, it takes a lot of time for me to visualize this kind of work.


### Issues
Most problems I encountered were a case of me not understanding how certain functions were supposed to be applied, especially map() which I really struggled with at first. There was a massive amount of trial and error in this assignment, and pasting random sections from p5 just to prove that it was ME writing things wrong, not Atom suddenly breaking.

### Further Discussion & Peers
I'm excited about knowing the object grouping system now, and I do feel like I learned a lot with this assignment. Things like noise and the map function are exciting, but I don't understand how a lot of the applications for them work at all. In general it felt like the scope and requirements made creating anything cohesive a lot more complicated. I know that the process is most of the assignment, not the end product, but when I can form an idea for what I want to make, and code to fit that plan, it keeps me from getting overwhelmed and I learn a lot more organically.
