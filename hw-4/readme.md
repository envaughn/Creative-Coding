## Ellis Vaughn
### Week Summary
1. I learned how different shapes and functions worked in p5 through the lesson plan.
2. Installed the color related Atom extensions.
2. Constructed a little guy, labeled his parts.
3. Referenced the p5 website a lot.
4. Sent him into the world.

### Process
This one was fun, but took me quite a bit of time to get through. I ended up using a lot more of the functions than I had expected to.

- I used translate() for the entire canvas, so I could copy the symmetrical features and just reverse the negative on the x-axis. This saved me quite a bit of time!
- I rotated the ellipse that makes the main body, because for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to make the flat side of the arc() face downward.
- Because I used rotate() I ended up needing the push() and pop() so the canvas didn't stay flipped. I think I used it in some places that I didn't need to, but I was trying to see what it did and didn't have an effect on.
- It was really convenient to use // to activate lines and figure out how I broke something.
- I liked the contrast with being deliberate with putting together stroke() and noStroke() on certain shapes.
- This is the first time since high school that I regretted dropping my Junior year math class.



### Issues
I don't understand how arc() really works, I found out how to do a half-circle almost on accident after messing around on the p5 webpage about them. The way I used translate() worked well for me, but I'm not really sure how it applies to specific objects, and not just the entire canvas. Other than those minor things I was able to figure this out through trial and error and I really like my results.


### Further Discussion & Peers
In terms of features I'm curious about, I want to explore using gradients in p5 if that's a possibility. Looking forward, the idea of making interactive work is very intimidating but this is a very interesting and versatile program.
I know that everyone has a different workflow but there were some additions in the examples/early submissions that didn't make sense to me. I wasn't too worried about it this time because I still made the little guy and my code is organized, but I'll just keep comparing them as we go.
